# Contributing to MeetingTimer

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to this project! 

We welcome anyone and everyone to this project. By reading and following these guidelines you will be helping to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. ü§ùüèº

## Getting started

### Issues
Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

### Pull Requests
Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

-   Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
-   If you've never contributed before, see  [this first timer's guide by the team at Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/)  for resources and tips on how to get started.
- Please complete the provided template with clear detail. 
- Ensure to update the [documentation](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/meeting-timer/blob/main/README.md) in the repository.

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the  ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1.  Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
2.  Clone the project to your machine
3.  Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4.  Commit changes to the branch
5.  Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6.  Push changes to your fork
7.  Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
